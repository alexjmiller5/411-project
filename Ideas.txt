ChatGPT chat app
  -We will create a chat app that will allow users to direclty chat with anyone they wish
  -We will use openAI's ChatGPT AI chat bot along with a description of the desired person in order to replicate this 
  -Users will need to create account for OAuth
  -An additional API we can call is Wastons sentiment analysis to give each conversation a score, it will start at neutral and we will also pass this conversation score
   to ChatGPT in order to influence responses 
  -The database will store user's login information as well as maybe a score of how kind they are based on what they ask the bot
  -The front end will be a simple messenger application with where the user can create a contact by adding a name and description, we will then store that and everytime 
   we call chatgpt we will first feed the prompt you are a *descirption* named *name*, question
